Here are some project ideas similar to yours that align with the UN's Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs):

**SDG 3: Good Health and Well-being**

* **Mobile mental health platform:**  Develop an app that connects users with mental health professionals for confidential consultations, therapy sessions, or support groups. This could be especially useful in regions with limited access to mental health services. 
* **AI-powered disease prediction:**  Create a platform that utilizes AI to analyze user data (with consent) and predict potential health risks. This could encourage preventative measures and early detection of diseases. 

**SDG 4: Quality Education**

* **Offline educational resource platform:**  Develop an app or website that provides access to educational materials (text, videos, quizzes) that can be downloaded and used even without an internet connection. This can benefit students in remote areas or with limited internet access.
* **Interactive language learning platform:**  Design a gamified app that makes learning new languages engaging and accessible for a wider audience. This can promote intercultural understanding and communication.

**SDG 6: Clean Water and Sanitation**

* **Water quality monitoring app:**  Create a platform that allows users to report water quality issues in their communities. This data can be used by authorities to identify and address sanitation problems.
* **Water conservation app:**  Develop an app that provides users with personalized tips and tools to conserve water in their daily lives. This can raise awareness about water scarcity and promote sustainable water use.

**SDG 7: Affordable and Clean Energy**

* **Energy consumption tracking app:**  Design an app that helps users track their energy consumption at home or work. This can encourage energy-saving behaviors and promote adoption of renewable energy sources.
* **Platform connecting people with renewable energy sources:**  Develop a platform that connects individuals or communities with options for installing solar panels, wind turbines, or other renewable energy solutions.

**SDG 11: Sustainable Cities and Communities**

* **Smart waste management platform:**  Create an app that allows users to report overflowing bins, littering incidents, or request waste collection services. This can improve waste management efficiency and cleanliness in urban areas.
* **Public transportation optimization app:**  Develop a platform that provides real-time information about public transportation schedules, delays, and optimal routes. This can encourage use of public transport and reduce traffic congestion.

These are just a few ideas to get you started. Remember, the key is to identify a specific need within an SDG and develop a technological solution that addresses it in a user-friendly and accessible way.
