Users of the platform could include:

1. **General Users**: These are individuals who download and use the app to report emergencies or request assistance. They could be anyone in need of emergency help, ranging from individuals experiencing medical emergencies to those in dangerous or threatening situations.

2. **Emergency Responders**: This category includes professionals such as paramedics, firefighters, police officers, and other first responders who receive and respond to emergency alerts through the platform. They may have access to specialized features and tools designed to aid them in their response efforts.

3. **Friends and Family Contacts**: Users may designate certain individuals, such as friends or family members, as emergency contacts. These contacts could receive notifications when the user reports an emergency, allowing them to provide support or assistance.

   - Incorporate features that allow NGOs to communicate and collaborate with other stakeholders, such as emergency service providers or government agencies, to streamline their response efforts.

6. **Community Leaders or Volunteers**:
   - Facilitate the formation of community groups or networks within the platform, allowing local leaders or volunteers to collaborate, exchange information, and coordinate community-based response efforts effectively.
   - Provide training resources and materials within the platform to empower community leaders and volunteers with the necessary knowledge and skills for emergency response.

7. **Government Officials or Administrators**:
   - Implement robust administrative functionalities that allow government officials to manage user accounts, access control, and permissions within the platform.
   - Develop customizable dashboards and reports that cater to the specific needs and responsibilities of government officials, enabling them to monitor the platform's performance and make informed decisions.
