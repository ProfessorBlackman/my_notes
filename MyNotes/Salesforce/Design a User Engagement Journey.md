Think of a user engagement journey in four phases:

- Onboarding: Say hello and make users feel welcome.  
- Feature adoption and discovery: Get users excited about the latest and greatest features.  
- Help and troubleshooting: Support users with minimally disruptive, relevant content.  
- Deeper learning: Help users learn more about complex concepts or tasks.
Now that you’re pretty familiar with the scenarios and phases, you begin to understand what your users need in each phase. Ask yourself:

- What’s the most helpful information I can offer at this stage? Focus on the top use cases and those aha moments.  
- What changes have an impact on users? Highlight those changes so users stay up to date.  
- Do different users require different information? Consider familiarity with the product and industry, motivation level, and product complexity. Then tailor the help to the user's role or goals.  
    

Before long, you’ll have a document (or set of documents) listing all the topics you want to cover. For example, in an onboarding strategy for new sales users, you might want to cover these topics.

- Tips and tricks for finding recent items, including search and favorites  
- Instructions for changing apps through the App Launcher  
- Instructions for personalizing the navigation bar and list views
- Quickstart guides for productivity features (such as notes, tasks, and calendar) and reporting, including dashboards  
    

Now that you know what you want to cover, you create the individual elements. Let’s start by mapping it out.

## MAP It Out
Identify the message, audience, and purpose of your content.

- The **message** is what you’re telling your users.  
- The **audience** is who you’re addressing.  
- The **purpose** is why you’ve chosen to communicate the message.  
    
Consider these examples.

| **Message (What)**                                                         | **Audience (Who)** | **Purpose (Why)**                  |
| -------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------ | ---------------------------------- |

| Bookmark your most-used records with Favorites.                            | All users          | Encourage use of Favorites.        |
