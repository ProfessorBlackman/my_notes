## Guidance Center and Learning Paths

The Guidance Center (![Guidance Center](https://res.cloudinary.com/hy4kyit2a/f_auto,fl_lossy,q_70/learn/modules/user-engagement/customize-the-help-menu/images/bb9909811e2a0aa2446a59047b6f018b_i.44.jpg)) is a panel in Lightning Experience that provides a convenient location for showing content that's assigned to the current user or recommended on the app, page, or object the user is working with. The Guidance Center includes not only suggested content that's authored by Salesforce but also custom content that you manage.

With Learning Paths enabled, you can add learning items—custom links, videos, and Trailhead modules—to the Guidance Center and assign those items to specific users with optional due dates.

Learning items in the Guidance Center can be general and apply to a range of purposes or jobs to be done. Or learning items can be specific to an app, page, or object. For example, on any page or app, show a link to a general onboarding video. Or, from the Opportunities page in the Sales app, show a link to a PDF or slide deck that describes opportunity management processes specific to your company.

## Learning Home

The Guidance Center is limited to a side panel in Lightning Experience. Depending on how many learning items you assign with Learning Paths, the Guidance Center can sometimes show only a subset of assigned items. Learning Home to the rescue! Learning Home is a separate page in Salesforce. The My Learning Content tab in Learning Home organizes all assigned learning items.

- The Required tab shows a user’s assigned learning items with specific due dates.  
- The Suggested tab shows a user’s assigned learning items without due dates.  
- The In Progress tab shows Trailhead or enablement site modules that a user has started, but not yet completed. (Links and videos are considered complete when a user first clicks them.)  
- The Completed tab shows learning items that a user has finished.
